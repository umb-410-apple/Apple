# Apple

Welcome to our Apple Corporation website! To view this website on the Web, the user can navigate to https://umb-410-apple.github.io/Apple/index.html using their preferred browser. 

Our page consists of a navigation bar at the top which you can use to navigate to the different sections of our website. Each of our names on the navigation bar will redirect the user to that team member's section of the page, which consists of their chosen image and buttons to both their info_nnnn.txt file and their personal websites on the CS server. Some team members decided to add a little flair (or secret!) to their section of the page as well. 

Below is a brief description of what each team member contributed to the website.

### Liam Willis

For this project, I largely served as the de-facto Scrum Master. Throughout the project, I assisted team members when they were struggling to improve their productivity. In particular, I helped many team members, both inside and outside of class, with many things relating to git. I assisted team members with setting up their local repositories, cloning the remote repository, committing changes, pushing changes, pulling, etc. I also helped team members more generally with workflow, including setting up the Project page (functioning as our Product Backlog), as well as how to add backlog items to the project page.

For the Apple Corporation website itself, I personally contributed several things to the website:
- The navigation bar at the top, including the buttons to each team member's section of the page
- The grid layout of the "Meet the Team!" section of the page
- The dark-themed color palette, consisting of peach colors combined with dark grey
- The style of buttons, which change size and color when hovered over by the cursor
- Other hover effects, including boxes in the "Meet the Team!" section expanding when hovered over by the cursor

For this project, my main mission was developing the website and the side mission was being a product owner. As a product owner, I communicated with my team about what things could be added to our website. As a developing person, I communicated with my team what some things I did and asked
for their feedback to improve the thing I just put onto the website. 

Here are my contribution to the Apple Corp website:
- Generalize photo frame for each team member so that they only need to put their image urls to have their photo showing on the website.
- Add UMB logo to the footer, and the logo will open the official UMB website whenever you click it.
- Add a small vanta globe scene on my person employee about grid.
- Create a vanta globe scene page with a slicer UI for color changing.
- Add an about us button on nav bar, create a about us page that contains a small description and two videos.

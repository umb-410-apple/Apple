Below describes the methods I used to test my contributions to ensure proper display, responsiveness, and interactivity across browsers.

1. Profile Image and Hover Effects
Testing Methods:
- Opened website in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- Hovered over image and buttons to confirm smooth glow animations.
- Checked glow consistency across light and dark themes.

Results:
All animations ran smoothly and did not overlap other elements.

2. Personal Website Link
Testing Methods:
- Click-tested the “My Website” button on all major browsers.
- Verified that the link opened in a new tab (target="_blank").
- Checked accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

Results:
Link consistently opened the correct destination with proper accessibility.

3. Footer Logo Alignment
Testing Methods:
- Resized browser windows to various width-to-height ratios (4:3, 16:9, 1:2).
- Ensured UMass Boston logo scaled proportionally and stayed aligned.

Results:
Footer layout remained balanced and visually consistent across resolutions.

4. Responsiveness and Layout Integrity
Testing Methods:
- Used Chrome DevTools to simulate mobile, tablet, and widescreen displays.
- Verified that all grid elements and animated buttons remained within layout.
- Ensured that animations did not interfere with navigation bar visibility.

Results:
Layout remained stable and responsive under all breakpoints.

5. Cross-Verification on CS Server
Testing Methods:
- Loaded the live CS server version to confirm that hosted behavior matched GitHub output.
- Double-checked that both the info_nnnn.txt link and website button functioned correctly.

Results:
All hosted elements worked as expected; no broken links or missing files found.

Verification Note:
All testing relates directly to my commits and updates from branch vraj23.

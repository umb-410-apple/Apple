Below are some work I did for this project and how I tested them.

1. Vanta scene page

There are four things that were added in the page: nav bar, a vanta globe scene, footer, and a slier ui for changing the color of the scene.
I preformed serval tests:
- On the main content page, clicked my employee about grid to make sure it directs me to the vanta scene page.
- One the vanta scene page, click each buttons on nav bar to make sure they redirect me back to the main content page.
- Make an new html body style to make sure the footer is always stick at the bottom regardless the height of the containers above it.
- Adjusted the content alignment of slicer ui, adjusted the position of slicer ui to make it right above the footer.

2. Mini Vanta scene on main content page

I added a small vanta globe scene inside my employee about grid.
I performed the following tests:
- Clicked the grid to make sure it directs to the vanta scene page which shows a bigger globe.
- Hovered the grid to make sure the hover effect is still functioning.
- Hovered the two buttons (info and personal website) to make sure the button hover effect is also functioning.
- Clicked the two buttons (info and personal website) to make sure I can still open my info and website by clicking the two buttons.

3. About us page

I created an about us page which contains nav bar, footer and small description about our team and some videos.
I performed the following tests:
- On nav bar in the main content page, clicked the about us button directs me to the about us page.
- On the about us page, clicked the buttons on nav bar to make sure they are working properly.
- Adjusted the position, width and padding for the description page.
- Adjusted the font size and font weight (title, subtitle, normal text) in the description page.
- Adjusted the layout of the video container, and the position of two videos. 

4. Falling apple mouse event

I made an mouse event, falling apple, which an apple will fall near the current position of the mouse when there is left click mouse event happening.
I performed the following tests:
- Left clicked the mouse on both main content page and about us page to see if it trigger the falling apple animation.
- Adjust the how the falling apple changes its position, rotation, and opacity over time during the animation.
- Left clicked those clickable buttons on nav bar and on other teammates' grids to make sure the animation will not play when I clicked those.
- Left clicked the footer, the employee name container, the employee about container and the empty space on nav bar, to make sure no falling apple 
  animation will be played under these conditions.
